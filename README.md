## DAY 1: PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

### Context: Director of AI Products at Major Fintech

**Your Role:**
- 3 Senior PMs reporting to you
- 4 AI products under management
- $5M total annual budget to allocate
- Revenue: $85M (growing)
- Constraint: No layoffs, must make tough choices

---

### Scenario 1: The $5M Budget Dilemma

#### Portfolio Overview

**Product A: Fraud Detection (Mature)**
- Current revenue: $50M/year
- Team size: 12 people
- Status: Stable, 0% YoY growth
- Business value: Reduces fraud losses, profit center
- Budget request: $2.5M
- 5-year potential: $60M (plateauing)
- Strategic position: Cash cow

**Product B: Recommendations (Growing)**
- Current revenue: $30M/year
- Team size: 8 people
- Status: Growing 5% YoY (underinvested)
- Business value: Increases engagement, retention, GMV
- Budget request: $2M
- 5-year potential: $100M (if funded properly)
- Strategic position: Growth engine

**Product C: Risk Scoring (New)**
- Current revenue: $5M/year
- Team size: 4 people
- Status: Unproven but showing promise (15% MoM growth)
- Business value: Reduces lending risk, enables higher underwriting volume
- Budget request: $2M
- 5-year potential: $80M (if it works)
- Strategic position: Strategic bet, future potential

**Total Budget Request:** $6.5M  
**Total Budget Available:** $5M  
**Gap:** -$1.5M

#### Stakeholder Pressures

**CEO/Board:** "Protect Fraud—it's our profit center"  
**VP Sales:** "Risk Scoring is market direction; invest or lose"  
**VP Engineering:** "Recommendations bleeding talent; need investment"  
**CFO:** "Make $5M work. No layoffs."

#### Your Decision (9.5/10)

**Allocation:**
- **Product A (Fraud):** $1.5M (-40% from request)
- **Product B (Recommendations):** $2.5M (+25% from request)
- **Product C (Risk Scoring):** $2.5M (+25% from request)

**Rationale:**
- Fraud is mature/stable → lower priority
- B and C show growth potential → invest there
- Reskill 2 people from Fraud to B/C (no layoffs)
- 5-year portfolio net value: +$20M

**Key Insight:** This isn't about cutting Fraud. It's about optimizing the entire portfolio for long-term value.

#### Stakeholder Communication

**To CEO (Protecting Profit Center Concern):**
> "Fraud remains our stable profit center. But if we invest in Risk Scoring, we prevent fraud upstream—better than detecting it downstream. This strengthens Fraud's future."

**To Sales (Risk Scoring Advocacy):**
> "Yes, Risk Scoring shows promise. We're investing appropriately and will validate against projections quarterly. If metrics exceed thresholds, we reallocate more."

**To Engineering (Talent Retention):**
> "Increasing Recommendations budget +25%. This addresses your talent concern while building a product with real growth potential."

#### The Plot Twist: Day 1 Afternoon

**New Information Arrives:**
- VP Sales reports: "Fraud margins are declining (commoditization)"
- Product A PM counter-proposes: "Cut $500K, hybrid role helping Risk Scoring"
- Best data scientist says: "I'm leaving if we don't innovate"

**Your Response:**
> "Acknowledge the counter-proposal. But budget cuts stand—portfolio strategy is sound. However, I can enable collaboration: If Risk Scoring PM agrees, you can work 30% on that product. This gives you innovation without budget exceptions. Sarah (Fraud PM) gets elevated title on her team."

**Why This Works:**
- Budget discipline maintained
- Enables cross-team collaboration (if both agree)
- Data scientist gets innovation he wants
- Sarah gets growth opportunity

---

**Your Portfolio Management Skills: 9.5/10**

---

---

## DAY 2: PEOPLE LEADERSHIP & TEAM DYNAMICS

### Core Principle

**The fundamental shift:**
- Day 1 asked: "How do I allocate resources?"
- Day 2 asks: "How do I develop people while maintaining performance?"

**This is harder because:** There's rarely a perfect answer. Just thoughtful tradeoffs.

---

### Scenario 2a: High-Performer Retention (Alex Chen)

#### The Crisis

**Alex Chen (Principal Data Scientist):**
- 8-year tenure, built core Fraud models
- $180K base + $80K bonus
- External offer: Stripe, $250K + $150K + VP-level exposure

**His words:**
> "I love it here. But Fraud is stable now—I'm optimizing, not building. At Stripe, they're building next generation from scratch. That's what excites me."

#### Your Analysis (9.5/10)

**The Real Problem (Not Just Money):**
- Alex isn't leaving for $70K/year raise
- He's leaving because Fraud feels **stagnant**
- He wants **challenge and new foundation building**
- Your portfolio cut signaled: "Fraud isn't our future"

**The Insight:** Solve his actual problem (boredom), not the symptom (money).

#### Your Counter-Offer

**Instead of:** Matching $250K salary  
**You offer:** Principal Data Scientist role leading Product C (Risk Scoring)

**Why this works:**
- He gets what he actually wants: new product, building foundation, technical leadership
- Company gets: Experienced architect for strategic bet
- Fraud team gets: Sarah elevated to Principal PM
- Sarah wins: Growth opportunity + mentoring

**Salary:** $180K initially, offer $210K if he proves Product C impact (6 months validation)

#### Communication

**To Alex:**
> "Building from scratch IS exciting. You can do that here in Product C. You'll architect the foundation, lead technical vision, build the team. That's the challenge you want. Can you commit 6 months?"

**To Sarah (Fraud PM):**
> "You're stepping up to lead Fraud as Principal PM. Your promotion came from Alex's move. We'll work closely. Then formalize your title and compensation at 6-month review."

**To CEO:**
> "We retained Alex by offering what he actually wanted: new technical challenges. He's moving to Product C. Sarah's stepping up on Fraud. Net: Keep top talent, strengthen portfolio."

#### Key Learning

**Retention isn't about money.** It's about growth, challenge, autonomy, impact. Find what people actually want and offer that.

---

### Scenario 2b: Underperformer Management (James)

#### The Crisis

**James (Senior PM, Compliance AI):**
- 6 months into role, missing targets 60%
- Revenue: $3M vs. $8M target
- Features: 2 shipped vs. 4 planned
- Team morale: Bleeding talent
- Stakeholder feedback: "James doesn't understand compliance"

#### Your Analysis (9.8/10)

**Key Insight:** This isn't a "fire James" problem. It's a **role design problem**.

**Root Causes:**
- **Structural:** James was VP at small company, struggles at scale
- **Design:** No clear separation between product strategy and technical execution
- **Support:** No Principal Data Scientist = no technical leadership bridge

#### Your Structured Support Plan (Not PIP, But "Structured Support")

**Phase 1: Stakeholder Alignment (Week 1-2)**
- Bring Legal, Compliance, Sales together
- Reset realistic expectations **collaboratively**
- James attends, listens, agrees on what's achievable

**Phase 2: Structural Support (Week 2-3)**
- Hire Principal Data Scientist from stable Product A
- PDS becomes bridge between James (product strategy) and technical team
- James: Product vision, stakeholder alignment
- PDS: Technical execution, team velocity

**Phase 3: Clear Metrics (Week 3+)**
- Revenue: $3M (realistic, not $8M)
- Features: 2 shipped (proven, then ramp)
- Stakeholder feedback: Improved (Legal/Sales positive)
- Review gates: 30/60/90 days

**Phase 4: Long-term**
- If succeeds: Gradually increase scope + compensation
- If struggles: Honest conversation at 90 days about fit

#### Key Learning

**Diagnose before judging.** Separate person from problem. Redesign roles instead of blaming people. Support with structure, not good intentions.

---

### Scenario 2c: Toxic High-Performer (David)

#### The Crisis

**David (Senior PM, Enterprise Sales AI):**
- Exceptional: $45M revenue, 25% YoY growth
- Toxic: Dismissive, undermines peers, doesn't follow processes
- Consequence: Team turnover, other PMs resentful
- HR: Complaint filed (verbal aggression)
- Board: "Can we clone David?"

#### Your Analysis (10/10)

**Key Insight:** This is a **values question, not a performance question.**

**The Dilemma:**
- If you ignore: Culture becomes "excellence = exception to rules"
- If you address: Might lose $45M revenue driver
- If you fire: Board questions your judgment

#### Your Accountability Strategy (10/10)

**Step 1: Gather Evidence**
- Get specific feedback from David's team
- Validate with data, not assumptions
- Ask: What words/behaviors are problematic?

**Step 2: Honest Conversation with David**
> "You're exceptional—that's fact. Here's what your team is saying..."
> (Relay specific testimonials, not interpretation)
> "This isn't about intent; it's about impact."
> "We value excellence AND respect. You need both."

**Step 3: Structured 90-Day Accountability**
- Clear behaviors to improve: Professional communication, valuing peers, following process
- Support: Coach, 360 feedback
- Decision gates: 30/60/90 days
- Contingency: If violations, escalate to CEO

**Step 4: Communicate to Stakeholders**
- To David's team: "We're addressing this. David has committed. Come to me if issues persist."
- To other PMs: "Everyone to same standard. Results + respect both required."
- To CEO/Board: "David is exceptional. We're ensuring he operates within our values."

#### The Core Question

**Do we believe excellence excuses culture violations?**

If yes: Short-term revenue, long-term toxic culture  
If no: Might lose $45M, but build sustainable culture  

**Your answer:** Hold David accountable. Culture is worth some revenue risk.

#### Key Learning

**Excellence doesn't excuse toxicity.** Make values-based decisions despite financial pressure. Be willing to lose revenue for culture.

---

### Scenario 2d: Hiring & Team Building (24-Person Expansion)

#### The Situation

**CEO Directive:** "Double team to 50 people. Hire 24 by end of Q1."

**Original Plan:**
- Product A: +6 people
- Product B: +5 people
- Product C: +7 people
- Product D: +6 people
- Budget: $3M
- Timeline: 3 months
- Diversity: 40% women, 30% URM

#### The Problem

**Math doesn't work:**
- Budget = $125K average (too low for quality talent)
- Timeline = 8 people/month (your team can't interview that many)
- Diversity targets vs. market reality (misalignment)
- Risk: Hire fast, get mediocre people (repeat James scenario)

#### Your Counter-Proposal (9.8/10)

**Revised Plan: 12 People (Not 24)**

**Headcount by Product:**
- **Product A:** 2 people (stable, limited growth need)
  - Move PDS back from Product D
  - Reduces hiring pressure

- **Product B:** 5 people (highest impact on engagement/retention)
  - ROI: $10M revenue from $625K investment = 16x

- **Product C:** 3 people (strategic bet)
  - ROI: $10M revenue from $375K investment = 27x

- **Product D:** 2 people (1 PDS + 1 Junior PM to help James)
  - ROI: $5M revenue from $250K investment = 20x

**Total:** 12 people, $1.625M budget, end of Q1, realistic diversity (30% women, 20% URM)

#### Business Case to CEO

**Revenue Impact:**
- Product B: +$10M
- Product C: +$10M
- Product D: +$5M
- **Total: +$25M from $1.625M = 15x ROI**

**Why This Works:**
- Quality hiring: 12 right people > 24 mediocre
- Onboarding: 12 manageable; 24 = chaos
- Team bandwidth: PMs can interview 12; 24 stretches them thin
- Cultural risk: Large cohort dilutes culture

#### Hiring Strategy

**Sourcing:**
- Employee referrals (best quality)
- Women in AI orgs (diversity + quality)
- HBCUs (diverse talent)
- Recruiting firms (if needed)

**Process:**
- You do screening (reduce PM load)
- PMs interview final 2-3 per role
- 2-round max (speed + quality)

**Diversity Actions:**
- Diverse interview panels
- Structured interviews (same questions)
- Partner with diversity orgs
- Referral bonus for diverse candidates

#### Key Learning

**Push back on unrealistic targets with data.** Quality > Quantity. Phased hiring > all-at-once. Give CEO choices, not ultimatums.

---

### Day 2 Key Frameworks

**Framework 1: High-Performer Retention**
1. Diagnose real reason (money? boredom? growth? team?)
2. Address root cause (move to energizing role, don't just raise salary)
3. Create growth paths that serve them AND org
4. Make it strategic ("This strengthens Product C")

**Framework 2: Underperformer Support**
1. Separate person from problem
2. Diagnose root cause (person? role? support?)
3. Restructure support (add resources, reset expectations)
4. Give fair chance (clear metrics + review gates)

**Framework 3: Toxic High-Performer Accountability**
1. Gather evidence (don't assume)
2. Address behavior, not character
3. Clear expectations (excellence AND respect both required)
4. Decision gates (escalate if violations)
5. Make values-based choice

**Framework 4: Hiring Under Constraint**
1. Prioritize by impact (not equal distribution)
2. Allocate by strategic value (growth > stability)
3. Challenge unrealistic targets (propose alternatives)
4. Quality > Quantity (always)
5. Phased approach (more sustainable)

---

### Day 2 Assessment: 9.8/10

**Mastered:**
✅ Empathy + Accountability  
✅ Systems thinking (see structural problems)  
✅ Constraint management (push back on targets)  
✅ Values-based decision making  
✅ Stakeholder communication  
✅ Long-term organizational thinking

---

---

## DAY 3: EXECUTIVE PRESENCE & INFLUENCE

### Core Principle

**The fundamental shift:**
- Days 1-2: "How do I manage my team and resources?"
- Day 3: "How do I shape the organization's direction and respond to external pressure?"

**Scope:** Board, CEO, entire company, market perception  
**Time horizon:** 1-3 years  
**Decisions:** Strategic bets, crisis response, market positioning, culture

---

### Scenario 1: The Board Presentation

#### Context

**Setting:** Q4 Board Meeting  
**Audience:** CEO, CFO, Board members (4 perspectives)  
**Time:** 15 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A  
**Goal:** Convince board to continue AI investment

#### Your Narrative: "The Virtuous Cycle"

**The Story Arc:**

1. **AI makes Fraud Detection stable**
   - Freed 4 resources from Fraud Detection
   - TP/FP/FN/TN metrics improved → +10% revenue

2. **Resources build Risk Scoring**
   - New product, new team, new opportunity
   - Accuracy improved 40% → -X% dependence on Fraud → +15% revenue
   - Feeds better data back into Fraud

3. **Stable Fraud feeds Recommendations**
   - AI integrated into Recommendations
   - Better recommendations + accuracy → +10% customer retention
   - Products interconnected, not siloed

4. **The Moat**
   - Competitors can build AI
   - But replicating this integrated system = 18-24 months
   - Our 3-year data head start = defensible
   - System complexity = hard to copy

#### Your Metrics Presentation

**Revenue Impact:**
| Product | Before AI | After AI | Growth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fraud Detection | $50M | $55M | +10% |
| Risk Scoring | $0M | $5M | New |
| Recommendations | $30M | $33M | +10% |
| **Total** | **$80M** | **$93M** | **+16%** |

**Efficiency:**
- Fraud: 12 → 8 people (4 freed)
- Recommendations: 10 → 6 people (redeployed)
- Net team: 35 → 40 (small growth, high redeployment)

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- Fraud TP Rate: 92% → 98.5%
- Risk Scoring Accuracy: 65% → 92% (over 18 months)
- Recommendation Precision: +25%

**Competitive Position:**
- Our head start: 18+ months
- To replicate: 18-24 months
- Our roadmap: Always 12-24 months ahead

#### Your 2025 Ask

**Phased Growth Model:**

**Year 1 (2025): Validate + Stabilize**
- Team: 45 people (maintain)
- Budget: $10M (up from $8M)
- Goal: 18% revenue growth
- Proof: AI ROI validated

**Year 2 (2026): Scale + Expand** (if 2025 targets hit)
- Team: 60 people
- Budget: $13M
- Goal: Launch 2 new AI products
- Proof: $150M+ total AI revenue

**Tying growth to performance protects both of us.**

#### Anticipated Board Questions & Answers

**Question: "If AI is so great, why only 8% of revenue?"**
> "Good question. AI is newer; we're intentionally pacing growth. Rush = poor quality. Better to build moat. If you look at customer value, AI products are 40% of lifetime value. Revenue is lagging indicator."

**Question: "Competitors are building AI too. What stops them?"**
> "Right. They're building AI. But THIS system—integrated fraud+risk+recommendations—takes 24 months. They'd need historical data (we have), team expertise (we have), integration complexity (time). We're betting they'll be 12 months behind. By then we'll have launched 2 more products."

**Question: "What if it doesn't work?"**
> "Two risks worth monitoring: Data quality (we review quarterly) and regulation (we work with Legal; 90% of decisions are explainable). Market shift? Actually accelerating, not slowing. We're under-investing risk, not over-investing."

---

### Scenario 2: Crisis Communication (AI Ethics Disaster)

#### The Situation

**Friday Morning, 8:47 AM:**
- Twitter: "Bank's AI flagged me for fraud based on ZIP code. That's discrimination."
- 50K retweets, news outlets picking it up
- Your customer service line: 200+ calls backed up

#### Your Immediate Response (9.3/10)

**Action (Next 2 Hours):**
- **Keep AI running** (for now)—don't panic-pause
- But ask Product PM: What actually happened?
- Investigation priority: Is this one-off or systematic?

**Investigation Priorities:**
1. **Did AI use ZIP code + job title as factors?** (Pull the model)
2. **Are these proxies for protected characteristics?** (Legal check)
3. **How many customers affected?** (Breadth check)
4. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?** (Process check)

**Investigation Timeline:**
- Preliminary findings: 24 hours (one-off or systematic?)
- Full audit: 5-7 days (deep statistical analysis)
- Interim update: 24 hours ("Here's what we found so far")
- Final report: 7 days

#### Your Public Statement (150-200 words)

> "We're aware of a customer allegation regarding a fraud detection decision. Fairness in AI is foundational to how we serve our customers.
>
> Here's what we're doing immediately:
>
> **Investigation:** Our product and data science teams are conducting a thorough analysis of the decision in question and reviewing our fraud detection model for any patterns of concern.
>
> **Process:** Any customer who believes they were unfairly flagged has immediate access to our appeals team for manual review.
>
> **Transparency:** We're engaging with regulators proactively and will share findings as we complete our investigation.
>
> **Commitment:** If we find any issues, we will fix them and communicate transparently with affected customers.
>
> We take this seriously. Our customers' trust is everything. We'll update stakeholders within 48 hours with findings and next steps."

#### 24-72 Hour Communication Plan

**Hour 0-2 (NOW):**
- [ ] Issue public statement
- [ ] Brief internal leadership
- [ ] Brief CS team (what to tell customers calling in)

**Hour 2-8:**
- [ ] Data science investigation begins
- [ ] Direct contact with affected customer (personal outreach)
- [ ] All-hands meeting (tell employees what's happening)
- [ ] Media response ("Investigating, more info in 24 hours")

**Hour 8-24:**
- [ ] Preliminary findings
- [ ] Board update (here's what we found, here's our plan)
- [ ] Board decision (approve plan or override)

**Day 2-3:**
- [ ] Full investigation results
- [ ] Public update (here's what we found, here's our fix, here's timeline)
- [ ] Customer notification (personalized based on findings)
- [ ] Regulatory notification (self-report to CFPB)

#### If Investigation Reveals Systemic Issue

**If AI IS using ZIP code + job title + they correlate with race/gender:**

**Your response:**
1. **Admit it:** "We found the issue. Here's what happened."
2. **Fix it:** Reduce feature weightage, retrain model
3. **Compensate:** Notify affected customers, offer remediation
4. **Report:** Self-report to regulators
5. **Prevent:** Audit process, monitoring, guardrails

**Why self-report:**
- Shows integrity (not hiding)
- Regulators respect transparency
- Reduces penalties
- Protects reputation long-term

#### Key Learning

**Crisis communication isn't about defending yourself. It's about transparency + action.** Admit, fix, prevent. Move fast. Self-report. Let facts speak.

---

### Scenario 3: Cross-Org Politics (The Impossible Conflict)

#### The Situation

**CEO Says:** "Sales wants Q2 launch. Engineering wants 16 weeks. Legal wants 6 weeks compliance. Make it work. Board meeting in 2 weeks. Need your answer: Q2 or Q3?"

**The Math:**
- Sales need: 8 weeks
- Engineering need: 16 weeks
- Legal need: 6 weeks
- Total realistic: 22 weeks (Q3)

**But:** Sales already told 50 customers "Q2"

#### Your Analysis (10/10)

**What's the Real Problem?**
- NOT timeline mismatch (8 vs. 22 weeks)
- It's **compliance + data quality**
- Pilot should be ready in 8 weeks
- Full rollout with compliance: 12 weeks

**Key Insight:** Reframe from "speed vs. quality" to "pilot-as-solution"

#### Your Solution: Phased Rollout with Metrics Gates (10/10)

**Phase 1: Proof of Concept Pilot (Weeks 1-8, Q2)**

**What:**
- Automated Underwriting core features
- 100% decisions reviewed by compliance team
- AI suggests, human decides, we compare accuracy

**Why Pilot Comes First:**
- Sales gets Q2 launch (real product, real customers)
- Engineering gets time for quality (8 weeks for core, realistic)
- Legal gets to review live decisions (compliance built-in)
- You get data to improve models

**Success Metrics:**
- Accuracy: AI matches human 85%+
- Data quality: Capture key patterns
- Compliance: Legal signs off process is fair
- Revenue: $200-500K proof of concept

**Timeline:** 8 weeks, Q2

---

**Phase 2: Full Rollout (Weeks 9-12, Q3)**

**What:**
- Full Automated Underwriting (100% automation)
- Based on Phase 1 learnings

**Why Full Rollout Comes Later:**
- Compliance fully signed off (non-negotiable gate)
- Model accuracy validated
- Infrastructure hardened
- Revenue: $20M+ annual

**Timeline:** 4 weeks, Q3 (assuming compliance ready)

#### How You Present This

**To VP Sales:**
> "Q2: Real pilot with real customers, generating real revenue ($200-500K). You tell those 50 customers 'You're in our beta. Help us build it.'
> Q3: Full launch, $20M+ revenue target.
> Win: Build right, launch confident. Not rush and fail."

**To VP Engineering:**
> "8 weeks Phase 1 (reasonable, not rushed). 4 weeks Phase 2 (hardening, not rebuilding). Pilot data informs decisions. Legal reviews in parallel, doesn't gate you.
> Win: Clean build, proper testing, real usage data."

**To General Counsel:**
> "Months 1-2: Review pilot decisions, build compliance framework (not racing). Months 2-3: Finalize sign-off. Full documentation from Phase 1.
> Win: You're partner, not blocker. Shaping the build, not stopping it."

**To CEO:**
> "Board in 2 weeks: 'We're launching Automated Underwriting pilot in Q2.' Q2: Real proof. Q3: Full rollout. Risk managed. Everyone wins."

#### Negotiation Strategy

**Step 1: One-on-ones (Before group meeting)**
- Talk to each VP individually
- Share proposal
- Get buy-in before the room
- Address specific concerns

**Step 2: Group Meeting**
- Present unified proposal
- Go around room: "Does this work for you?"
- Get explicit yes/no from each
- Address pushback right there

**Step 3: To CEO**
- "Everyone aligned. Here's the plan. Board-ready."

#### Key Learning

**Influence without authority.** Reframe problems so everyone wins. Make metrics the decision gate. Find parallel workstreams. Give stakeholders choices.

## UNIVERSAL DIRECTOR FRAMEWORKS

### Framework 1: Portfolio Allocation

**When:** Distributing resources across multiple products/teams

**Steps:**
1. Categorize by lifecycle (cash cow, growth engine, strategic bet)
2. Allocate by strategic value (not just current revenue)
3. Quantify portfolio impact (5-year net value)
4. Find constraint-breaking solutions (reskilling, redeployment)
5. Set trigger points for reallocation

**Key Principle:** Optimize for portfolio, not individual products

---

### Framework 2: Stakeholder Navigation

**When:** Managing conflicting interests from multiple leaders

**Steps:**
1. Listen before deciding (create space for proposals)
2. Reframe concerns (address root issues, not surface)
3. Separate real concerns from incentive bias
4. Communicate differently per stakeholder
5. Set clear expectations

**Key Principle:** Everyone's concern is valid; find where interests overlap

---

### Framework 3: People Development Under Pressure

**When:** Managing retention, underperformance, accountability, scaling

**Retention:** Diagnose real reason → address root cause → create growth path → make strategic  
**Underperformance:** Separate person from problem → diagnose → restructure support → give fair chance  
**Accountability:** Gather evidence → address behavior → set expectations → have decision gates  
**Scaling:** Prioritize by impact → allocate by value → challenge unrealistic targets → quality > quantity

**Key Principle:** Each situation needs different approach, but all require empathy + accountability

---

### Framework 4: Crisis Communication

**When:** Public issue, regulatory concern, customer harm

**Steps:**
1. Don't panic—get facts first
2. Investigate immediately (diagnosis guides response)
3. Communicate proactively (transparency beats silence)
4. Self-report if needed (integrity > liability)
5. Fix + prevent (action, not just words)

**Key Principle:** Speed of judgment + transparency of communication = credibility

---

### Framework 5: Cross-Org Influence

**When:** Need to align multiple departments with conflicting interests

**Steps:**
1. Understand each stakeholder's constraints (1-on-1s first)
2. Reframe problem so everyone can win
3. Find parallel workstreams (eliminate sequential delays)
4. Make metrics the decision gate (not time/authority)
5. Build consensus before group meeting

**Key Principle:** Influence without authority = finding solutions where all interests align

## TIME MANAGEMENT AT DIRECTOR LEVEL

### The Critical Insight

| Level | Time = |
|---|---|
| Individual Contributor | Your output |
| Senior PM | Your + team's output |
| Director | Team's output (your leverage) |
| VP | Org's strategic direction (entire company) |

### Your Weekly Time Allocation (40 Hours)

| Block | Hours/Week | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Thinking/Strategy** | 5-6 | Direction setting | "Where is Product C going? What's our competitive threat?" |
| **1-on-1s** | 4-5 | People development | Sarah's leadership growth, James's support |
| **Decision Gates** | 2-3 | Unblock team | Hiring approvals, portfolio decisions |
| **Meetings** | 10-12 | Org alignment | CEO sync, cross-functional |
| **Execution/Support** | 8-10 | Help team | Coach through crises, mentor |
| **Admin/Email** | 5-8 | Necessary overhead | Emails, documentation |

### Calendar as Strategy

**What your calendar signals:**
- 60% meetings, 0% thinking → Reactive
- 20% thinking, 5% 1-on-1s → Strategic but neglecting people
- 50% 1-on-1s, 0% strategy → Micromanaging

**Your calendar IS your strategy.** Allocate time to what matters.

### Implementation Rules

1. **Block thinking time:** Monday 8-10 AM (no interruptions)
2. **Batch decisions:** Monday 2 PM, Wednesday 10 AM, Thursday 3 PM
3. **Protect PMs' time:** Cap their meetings at 40% of week
4. **Say no to meetings:** "Not needed; update me later"
5. **Create decision records:** Document why you decided X
